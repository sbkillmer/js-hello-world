/*  
Welcome, new coder. 
Enter your code on line 7 to print 'Hello, World!' 
to the console (the panel on the right)
*/

console.log("Nice to meet you.")
console.log(10+10)
console.log("The Quick Brown Fox"); console.log("pause for dramatic effect")
console.log("Jumped Over " + "The Lazy Dog")
console.log('Quoth the Raven "Nevermore"')
console.log(" ")

console.log(x)

/*  
Next, PLAY! 
Modify your code on line 7 to try to accomplish the tasks listed below:

   1. Change the message that is printed. (Done)
   2. Figure out what the parentheses do. Will the code work without them? (No)
   3. Remove one or both quotation marks. Do we need to include both opening and closing quote marks? (Seems like both are needed) Is there a difference between using a single or a double quote (' vs. ")? (Both work)
   4. Remove the semi-colon, ;. (Still works)
   5. Print a number. (Bonus: Print two numbers added together). (Works after removing quotation marks)
   6. Print multiple messages one after the other.(Done using the semicolon)
   7. Print two messages on the same line.
   (See Jumped Over + The Lazy Dog)
   8. Print a message that contains quote marks, such as Quoth the Raven "Nevermore".
   (Double quotes within a single quote line)
   9. Other. You choose! (Created a line break with empty quotes, tested multiplication, attempt define and call variable)
